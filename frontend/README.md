This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) + [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) project bootstrapped with [`create-wagmi`](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi/tree/main/packages/create-wagmi)

# Installation & Setup

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install the dependencies.
2. Copy and rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the API keys for Infura and Alchemy.

# Running the project

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal, and then open [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser. Port 3000 is reserved for the backend.
